# Monster Menu HP

This plugin shows the hitpoints of monsters in their right click menu entry. This is especially useful for barraging 
stacks of monsters, as it shows you which one has the most HP and thus which one you should click on. 
**Note: this will not work with NPCs highlighted using the NPC indicators plugin.**
